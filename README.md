# GoldBach

Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

## What does our algorithm do?

We are looking for a optimized way to computing very fast and in a liner speed not in exponential speed, the most biggest even number that culculated with ***Super Computers*** is  4Ã—10<sup>18</sup>. Maybe you think that How can we prove Goldbach conjecture with programming?, So I must say that we dont want to prove it, We are looking for a Counterexample so that's why We insist on speeding up the algorithm.
